# c3docgen

program to generate documents from c3 source files.

will search for all .c3 files and create documents from sources.
by default, it will generate separate .md files for each module.

c3docgen mono will generate a single file with all the modules.

TODO: currently has no way of reading multiple modules in a single file.
